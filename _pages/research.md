<!--Our research lies at the intersection of next-generation wireless networks, wireless
sensing, and smart device systems. We are particularly interested in creating agile, adaptable, smart, secure, and
scalable wireless systems with an emphasis on millimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) networks,

<!--## Robust and Scalable Millimeter-Wave Networks

Today, the GHz-scale unlicensed spectrum coupled with directional antennas can support Gbps data
rates in point-to-point links. Next-generation devices aim to scale to dense user populations via the
concurrent transmission of multiple independent data streams, i.e., downlink and uplink multi-user
MIMO. However, while the utilization of high frequencies and wide spectrum represents a significant advancement in achieving higher data rates, the challenge of ensuring robustness in the presence of human blockage and client mobility remains a significant obstacle for highly directional links. 
To address these challenges, we are actively engaged in the theoretical and experimental development of novel cross-layer techniques. 
These techniques aim to enable adaptable and resilient mm-Wave networks that can effectively scale to accommodate dense user populations. -->

  Scaling spectrum access towards terahertz will provide a key ingredient to realize the sixth generation
  and beyond of wireless networks. In this work, we develop the foundations for scaling wireless networks to
  Terabits per second (Tb/sec) via coupling new advances in Terahertz-scale (THz) communication and
  sensing. Indeed, different propagation characteristics, wide bandwidth, directionality, and lack of real-time adaptation prevent     today's THz wireless technologies from efficiently scaling up and supporting mobile users. This project will tackle the fundamental 
 barriers of mobile THz communication and sensing. In particular, the project will design and build practical, scalable, mobile THz 
 wireless technologies for next-generation communication and sensing systems.
