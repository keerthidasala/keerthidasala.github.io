<!--
I'm a wireless networking and communications researcher. Currently, I am working on cross-layer MAC-PHY protocol design and implementation to scale the data rate and spatial multiplexing potential in High-Frequency mmWave networks.
My research interests span areas of wireless communications and networking, signal estimation and detection, mathematical modeling and protocol design for next-generation wireless networks (5G and beyond), information theory and coding, cellular networks and high frequency (mmWave) protocols and applications.
I'm associated with [Rice Networks Group](http://networks.rice.edu) at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department, Rice University, Houston, Texas. I am being advised by [Dr.Edward W.Knightly](https://knightly.rice.edu/). 
Previously, I have completed my Masters in Electrical Engineering from IISc Bangalore, India

My research broadly focuses on theoretical analysis and modeling to hardware implementations and experimental evaluations of architectures, protocols, and applications for next-generation wireless communication and sensing systems with a focus on millimeter-wave and Terahertz networks. The research is multi-disciplinary cutting across electromagnetics and antennas to protocol design, algorithm, signal processing, and end-to-end systems. 

I am also interested all aspects of wireless security, robotic wireless networks, internet of things, cellular & UAV/drone networks, AI for network management and control, mathematical modeling and protocol design for next-generation wireless networks (5G+, 6G and beyond), and information theory and coding.
