I'm a wireless networking and communications researcher. Currently, I am working on h cross-layer MAC-PHY protocol design and implementation to scale the data rate and spatial multiplexing potential in High-Frequency mmWave networks. 

My research interests span areas of wireless communications and networking, signal estimation and detection, mathematical modeling and protocol design for 5G, information theory and coding, cellular networks and high frequency (mmWave) protocols and applications.

I'm associated witj [Rice Networks Group](http://networks.rice.edu) at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department, Rice University. I am being advised by [Dr.Edward W.Knightly](https://knightly.rice.edu/). 

Previously, I have completed my Masters in Electrical Engineering from IISc Bangalore, India.
