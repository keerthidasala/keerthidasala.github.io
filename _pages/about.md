<!--
I'm a wireless networking and communications researcher. Currently, I am working on cross-layer MAC-PHY protocol design and implementation to scale the data rate and spatial multiplexing potential in High-Frequency mmWave networks.
My research interests span areas of wireless communications and networking, signal estimation and detection, mathematical modeling and protocol design for next-generation wireless networks (5G and beyond), information theory and coding, cellular networks and high frequency (mmWave) protocols and applications.
I'm associated with [Rice Networks Group](http://networks.rice.edu) at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department, Rice University, Houston, Texas. I am being advised by [Dr.Edward W.Knightly](https://knightly.rice.edu/). 
Previously, I have completed my Masters in Electrical Engineering from IISc Bangalore, India

Hello!

I am Keerthi Dasala and this is my personal website. 

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rice University. I am a member of [Rice Networks Group](http://networks.rice.edu) and advised by [Prof. Edward Knightly](https://knightly.rice.edu/). Prior to joining Rice, I completed my Masters in Electrical and Communications Engineering from IISc. 

My current research focuses on theoretical analysis and modeling to hardware implementations and experimental evaluations of architectures, protocols, and applications for next-generation wireless communication systems with a focus on mmWave and THz WLANs.

<!--cross-layer MAC-PHY protocol design and experimental implementation to scale the data rate and spatial multiplexing potential in mmWave and THz WLANs. -->

I am broadly interested in wireless communications and networking, signal estimation and detection, mathematical modeling and protocol design for next-generation wireless networks (5G and beyond), information theory and coding, and high frequency (mmWave and THz) network protocols and applications.
