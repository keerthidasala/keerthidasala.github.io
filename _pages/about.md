<!--
I'm a wireless networking and communications researcher. Currently, I am working on cross-layer MAC-PHY protocol design and implementation to scale the data rate and spatial multiplexing potential in High-Frequency mmWave networks.
My research interests span areas of wireless communications and networking, signal estimation and detection, mathematical modeling and protocol design for next-generation wireless networks (5G and beyond), information theory and coding, cellular networks and high frequency (mmWave) protocols and applications.
I'm associated with [Rice Networks Group](http://networks.rice.edu) at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department, Rice University, Houston, Texas. I am being advised by [Dr.Edward W.Knightly](https://knightly.rice.edu/). 
Previously, I have completed my Masters in Electrical Engineering from IISc Bangalore, India

Hello!

I am Keerthi Dasala and this is my personal website. 

<h3>  I am on the academic job market !!! </h3>

I obtained my Ph.D. from Rice University in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in August 2022. 
<!-- and currently working as a Senior Research Engineer at Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. towards the design and development of next-generation wireless networks. -->
My thesis work, is on [Design and Experimental Evaluation of Next-Generation Multi-User WLANs from Millimeter-Wave to Terahertz](https://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/113234) 

My thesis advisor is [Prof. Edward Knightly](https://knightly.rice.edu/). Prior to joining Rice, I completed my Masters in Electrical and Communications Engineering from IISc. 

<!-- I finished my in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rice University. I am a member of [Rice Networks Group](http://networks.rice.edu) and advised by [Prof. Edward Knightly](https://knightly.rice.edu/).  -->

### **My Research**

My research focuses on theoretical analysis and modeling to hardware implementations and experimental evaluations of architectures, protocols, and applications for next-generation wireless communication systems with a focus on millimeter-wave and Terahertz networks.

<!--cross-layer MAC-PHY protocol design and experimental implementation to scale the data rate and spatial multiplexing potential in mmWave and THz WLANs. -->

I am broadly interested in wireless communications and sensing, robotic wireless networks, internet of things, wireless security, mathematical modeling and protocol design for next-generation wireless networks (5G and beyond), information theory and coding.

Reflecting the multi-disciplinary nature of my research, my results have been pub- lished in premier venues and journals in the areas of mobile computing and wireless networks. I have been named as a Star Doctoral Student in Rice ECE in 2021 and received numerous recognitions for my research, including the Texas Instruments Distinguished Fellowship, Best Paper Award in IEEE INFOCOM 2021, Best Paper Award in IEEE VTC 2020, CRA-WP and Grace Hopper
Scholarship, and N2Women Young Researcher Fellowship. I
