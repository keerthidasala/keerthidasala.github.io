I'm a wireless networking and communications researcher. Currently, I am working on cross-layer MAC-PHY protocol design and implementation to scale the data rate and spatial multiplexing potential in High-Frequency mmWave networks.

My research interests span areas of wireless communications and networking, signal estimation and detection, mathematical modeling and protocol design for next-generation wireless networks (5G and beyond), information theory and coding, cellular networks and high frequency (mmWave) protocols and applications.

I'm associated with [Rice Networks Group](http://networks.rice.edu) at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department, Rice University, Houston, Texas. I am being advised by [Dr.Edward W.Knightly](https://knightly.rice.edu/). 

Previously, I have completed my Masters in Electrical Engineering from IISc Bangalore, India

Hello!

I am Keerthi Dasala and this is my personal website. 

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rice University. I am a member of [Rice Networks Group](http://networks.rice.edu) and advised by [Prof. Edward Knightly](https://knightly.rice.edu/). Prior to joining Rice, I completed my Masters in Electrical and Communications Engineering from IISc. 

My current research focuses on cross-layer MAC-PHY protocol design and implementation to scale the data rate and spatial multiplexing potential in high-frequency mmWave networks.

I am broadly interested in wireless communications and networking, signal estimation and detection, mathematical modeling and protocol design for next-generation wireless networks (5G and beyond), information theory and coding, and high frequency (mmWave and THz) network protocols and applications.
