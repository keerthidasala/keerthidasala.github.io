<!--
I'm a wireless networking and communications researcher. Currently, I am working on cross-layer MAC-PHY protocol design and implementation to scale the data rate and spatial multiplexing potential in High-Frequency mmWave networks.
My research interests span areas of wireless communications and networking, signal estimation and detection, mathematical modeling and protocol design for next-generation wireless networks (5G and beyond), information theory and coding, cellular networks and high frequency (mmWave) protocols and applications.
I'm associated with [Rice Networks Group](http://networks.rice.edu) at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department, Rice University, Houston, Texas. I am being advised by [Dr.Edward W.Knightly](https://knightly.rice.edu/). 
Previously, I have completed my Masters in Electrical Engineering from IISc Bangalore, India

## About me


<!--I am Keerthi Dasala. I received my Ph.D. from Rice University in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://eceweb.rice.edu/) in December 2022, where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Edward Knightly](https://knightly.rice.edu/) and was a member of [Rice Networks Group](http://networks.rice.edu). I am currently working as a Senior Research Engineer at Qualcomm Wireless R&D towards designing and developing next-generation wireless networks.--> 
<!-- <h3>  I am on the academic job market. Interested in Tenure-Track positions in broad area of wireless communication and networking. </h3> -->

<!--I started as an Assistant Professor at Purdue University in the [Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) as of January 2024. I received my Ph.D. from Rice University in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://eceweb.rice.edu/) in December 2022, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Edward Knightly](https://knightly.rice.edu/).
<br>--> 
I am an Assistant Professor at Purdue University in the [Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE). I direct the [WISDOM Lab](https://keerthidasala.github.io/WISDOM-Research-Lab/) within Purdue ECE.

My research broadly focuses on theoretical analysis and modeling to hardware implementations and experimental evaluations of architectures, protocols, and applications for Next-Generation wireless communication and sensing systems, focusing on the Millimeter-wave and Terahertz spectrum. The research is multi-disciplinary, cutting across electromagnetics and antennas to protocol design, algorithm, signal processing, and end-to-end systems. I strive to combine theory and experimentation to motivate, develop, and validate my research, with the hope of impacting real-world wireless systems.

I am also interested in all aspects of wireless security, robotic wireless networks, the internet of Things, cellular & UAV/drone networks, AI for network management and control, mathematical modeling, and protocol design for next-generation wireless networks (5G+, 6G and beyond), and information theory and coding.

Refer [Research](./research) for current research directions.
